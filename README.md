### network-event-broker
----
A daemon configures network on ```systemd-networkd's``` [DBus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) events. Use cases like a way to run a command when get a new ip via dhcp. As of now there is no native ```systemd-networkd``` solution for this problem. Afterburn listens to dbus signals and reacts according to the events. It's written in golang.

```network-event-broker``` creates link state directories ```carrier.d```,  ```configured.d```,  ```degraded.d```  ```no-carrier.d```  ```routable.d``` and manager state dir ```manager.d``` in ```/etc/network-event-broker```. Executable scripts can be placed into directories that reflect systemd-networkd operational states, and are executed when the daemon receives the relevant event from `systemd-networkd`. See [networkctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/networkctl.html).

```bash
❯ networkctl list

IDX LINK    TYPE     OPERATIONAL SETUP
  1 lo      loopback carrier     unmanaged
  2 ens33   ether    routable    configured
  3 ens37   ether    routable    unmanaged
  4 virbr0  bridge   no-carrier  unmanaged

4 links listed.
```

Enviroment variables ```OperationalState=``` , ```LINK=```, ```LINKIFINDEX=``` and DHCP lease information ```DHCP_LEASE= ``` passed to the scripts via enviroment viariables.

```bash
May 14 17:08:13 Zeus cat[273185]: OperationalState="routable"
May 14 17:08:13 Zeus cat[273185]: LINK=ens33
```


#### Building from source
----

```bash

❯ make build
❯ sudo make install

```

### Configuration
----

Configuration file `network-broker.toml` located in ```/etc/network-broker/``` directory to manage the configuration.
The `[Network]` section takes following Keys:

```bash
Links=
```
A whitespace-separated list of links for which routing policy rules would be configured per address.


The `[System]` section takes following Keys:
``` bash
LogLevel=
```
Specifies the log level. Takes one of `info`, `debug` ... Defaults to `info`.


```bash

❯ sudo cat /etc/network-broker/network-broker.toml
[System]
LogLevel="debug"

[Network]
Links="ens33 ens37"                    
```

```bash

❯ systemctl status network-broker.service
