### network-event-broker
----
A daemon configures network and executes scripts on network events such as `systemd-networkd's` [DBus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) events,
`dhclient` gains lease lease. It also watches when

1. An address getting added/removed/modified.
2. Links added/removed.

```network-event-broker``` creates link state directories ```carrier.d```,  ```configured.d```,  ```degraded.d```  ```no-carrier.d```  ```routable.d``` and manager state dir ```manager.d``` in ```/etc/network-event-broker```. Executable scripts can be placed into directories.

Use cases:

How to run a command when get a new address is acquired via DHCP ?

1. `systemd-networkd's`
 Scripts are executed when the daemon receives the relevant event from `systemd-networkd`. See [networkctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/networkctl.html).


```bash
May 14 17:08:13 Zeus cat[273185]: OperationalState="routable"
May 14 17:08:13 Zeus cat[273185]: LINK=ens33
```

2. `dhclient`
  For `dhclient` scripts will be executed (in the dir ```routable.d```) when the `/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases` file gets modified by `dhclient` and lease information is passed to the scripts as environmental arguments.

Environment variables `LINK`, `LINKINDEX=` and DHCP lease information `DHCP_LEASE=`  passed to the scripts.

#### Building from source
----

```bash

❯ make build
❯ sudo make install

```

Due to security `network-broker` runs in non root user `network-broker`. It drops all privileges except CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

```bash
❯  useradd -M -s /usr/bin/nologin network-broker
```

### Configuration
----

Configuration file `network-broker.toml` located in ```/etc/network-broker/``` directory to manage the configuration.

The `[System]` section takes following Keys:
``` bash

LogLevel=
```
Specifies the log level. Takes one of `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug` and `fatal`. Defaults to `info`.

```bash

Generator= 
```
Specifies the network event generator source to listen. Takes one of `systemd-networkd` or `dhclient`. Defaults to `systemd-networkd`.


The `[Network]` section takes following Keys:

```bash

Links=
```
A whitespace-separated list of links whose events should be monitored. Defaults to unset.

```bash

RoutingPolicyRules=
```
A whitespace-separated list of links for which routing policy rules would be configured per address. When set, `network-broker` automatically adds routing policy rules `from` and `to` in another routing table `(ROUTE_TABLE_BASE = 9999 + ifindex)`. When these addresses are removed, the routing policy rules are also dropped. Defaults to unset.

```bash
EmitJSON=
```
A boolean. When true, JSON format data will be emitted via envorment variable `JSON=` Applies only for `systemd-networkd`. Defaults to true.

```json
{
   "AddressState":"routable",
   "AlternativeNames":null,
   "CarrierState":"carrier",
   "Driver":"e1000",
   "IPv4AddressState":"routable",

      "172.16.130.2"
   ],
   "Domains":null,
   "NTP":null
}

```

```bash
UseDNS=
```
A boolean. When true, the DNS server will be se to `systemd-resolved` vis DBus. Applies only for DHClient. Defaults to false.

```bash
UseDomain=
```
A boolean. When true, the DNS domains will be sent to `systemd-resolved` vis DBus. Applies only for DHClient. Defaults to false.

```bash
UseHostname=
```
A boolean. When true, the host name be sent to `systemd-hostnamed` vis DBus. Applies only for DHClient. Defaults to false.

```bash
❯ sudo cat /etc/network-broker/network-broker.toml 
[System]
LogLevel="debug"
Generator="systemd-networks"

[Network]
Links="eth0 eth1"
RoutingPolicyRules="eth0 eth1"
